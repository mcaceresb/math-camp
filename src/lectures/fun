  \item I first encountered the definition of compactness several years ago during my undergraduate real analysis course. To be perfectly honest, I thought the definition was rather disconcerting,\footnote{To be candid, I legit thought ``the fuck is this?''}  and I heavily relied on the ``closed and bounded'' intuition and the sequential compactness characterization to get through that part of the course.

    My point is that you shouldn't be too concerned if you don't find compactness terribly easy at first. It is a difficult and deep concept to wrap your head around (at least I think so). I am sure you'll get there (:

  \item It is rumored than when John Nash came to John Von Neumann to discuss his ideas and his proof, the latter interrupted to dismiss the result as trivial: ``That's just a fixed point theorem,'' he said. I always found this anecdote to be quite fascinating, in particular given the extent to which game theory plays a role in modern economics.
